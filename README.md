## Raspberry Pi Zero (2) W based Smoker Grill Controller using Python 3 and Flask/Gunicorn/nginx
*Also uses Bootstrap 4 (http://getbootstrap.com/) w/jQuery and Popper support*

***Note:*** *This project is continuously evolving, and thus this readme will likely be improved over time, as I find the inspiration to make adjustments.  That being said, I'm sure there will be many errors that I have overlooked or sections that I haven't updated. This project is something I've done for both fun and for self-education.  If you decide to implement this project for yourself, and run into issues/challenges, feel free to submit an issue here on GitHub.  However, I would highly encourage you to dig in and debug the issue as much as you can on your own for the sake of growing your own knowledge.  Also, I have a very demanding day job, a family, and lots of barbeque to make - so please have patience with me.*

***Warning:*** *The creator of this project takes no responsibility for any damage that you may do to your personal property including modifications to your smoker grill if you choose to use this project.  The creator also takes no responsibility for any resulting harm or damages that may come from issues with the hardware or software design.*  ***This project is provided for educational purposes, and should be attempted only by individuals who wish to assume all risks involved.***

### Introduction
This project was inspired by user dborello and his excellent PiSmoker project (http://engineeredmusings.com/pismoker/ and https://github.com/DBorello/PiSmoker).  I encourage you to check it out and get a rough idea of how this all works.  This particular project was built around a Traeger Texas smoker grill platform, but should work for most older Traeger models (or other brands with similar parts like the older Pit Boss) built with similar parts (fan, auger, and igniter).  I've built the code in a way to be somewhat modular & extensible such that you can replace the grill platform with your own specific platform instead.  Newer Traeger grills with their newer wifi enabled controllers have DC components (instead of the AC Fan / Auger) and aren't covered by this project.  

Just as with the PiSmoker project, I had a few goals in mind.  I also wanted to have tighter temperature controls, wireless control, and plotting of the grill / meat temperatures.  In addition, I wanted to design this project such that original smoker controller could be used if needed.  This way, if I wanted to, I could use my controller as a monitoring device for temperatures instead of controlling the temperature and leave that up to the original controller.  Basically, it was my fallback plan in case my project didn't work out, or if I wanted to do a quick cook on the Traeger without using the fancy GUI.  **UPDATE (11/2021)** After spending lots of time with PiFire, I've finally removed the original controller in favor of using PiFire exclusivesly.  However, this doesn't mean that you can't still retain your original controller if you want.  Both modes work fine.

### Features

* WiFi Enabled Access & Control (WebUI) via computer, phone or tablet
* Multiple Cook Modes
    * _Startup Mode_ (fixed auger on times with igniter on)
    * _Smoke Mode_ (fixed auger on times)
    * _Hold Mode_ (variable auger on times) using PID for higher accuracy
    * _Shutdown Mode_ (auger off, fan on) to burn off pellets after cook is completed
    * _Monitor Mode_ - See temperatures of grill / probes and get notifications if using another controller or if just checking the temperatures any time.
    * _Manual Mode_ - Control fan, auger and igniter manually.
* Supports several different OLED and LCD screens
    * SSD1306 OLED Display
    * ST7789 TFT Display
    * ILI9341 TFT Display
* Physical Button Input / Control (depending on the display, three button inputs)
* One (1) Grill Probe and Two (2) Food Probes
    * Tunable probe inputs to allow for many different probe manufacturers
    * Probe tuning tool to help develop probe profiles
* Cook Timer
* Notifications (Grill / Food Probes / Timer)
    * Supports IFTTT, Pushover, and Pushbullet Notification Services
* Smoke Plus Feature to deliver more smoke during Smoke / Hold modes
* Safety settings to prevent over-temp, startup failure, or firepot flameout (and overload)
* Temperature History for all probes / set points
* Wood Pellet Tracking Manager
* Pellet Level Sensor Support
    * VL53L0X Time of Flight Sensor
    * HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* Socket IO for Android Application Support _(GitHub User [@weberbox](https://github.com/weberbox) has made a Android client app under development here: [https://github.com/weberbox/PiFire-Android](https://github.com/weberbox/PiFire-Android))_
* ...And much more!

### Screenshots & Videos

The dashboard is where most of your key information and controls are at.  This is the screen that greets you when you access the PiFire WebUI on your computer, smart phone or tablet in a browser.

![Dashboard](docs/webui/PiFire-Dashboard-00.png)

For those of us who like to see the data, PiFire allows you to graph and save your cook history.  It's also a great way to monitor your cook in realtime.  

![History](docs/webui/PiFire-History-00.png)

PiFire also provides an optional Pellet Manager which can help you track your pellet usage, store ratings, check your pellet level if you have a pellet sensor equipped.

This is what PiFire looks like on your mobile device.  And in these screen shots you'll notice that we have dark mode enabled.  This helps for viewing at night, or just if you like the dark theme better.  Personally I think it looks pretty slick.

Below is an example comparison that I did on a real cook of the Traeger controller attempting to hold 275F and the PiFire holding at the same temperature.  The difference is very impressive.  The Traeger swings massively up to 25F over and under the set temperature.  However the PID in from PiSmoker does a great job holding roughly +-7 degrees.  And this is without any extra tuning.

Here's a brief YouTube video giving a basic overview of the PiFire web interfaces.

Here is a the latest version 2.0 of the hardware w/TFT screen and hardware buttons in a custom 3D printed enclosure. We've come a long way since v1.0.
